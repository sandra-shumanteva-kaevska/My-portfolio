# My-portfolio

This project is my personal portfolio

## The problem

To create my personal portfolio I had to be creative and work with HTML and CSS. To organize the CSS i used BEM naming convention for the classes which help a lot and simplified most of the components. I used Open Graph meta tags so the site can better shared on social networks.
